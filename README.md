Simple program for creating anaglyph from left and right images
You can use /out/artifacts/anaglyph_build/anaglyph_build.jar file, containing generated application, as a separate application.

For successful anaglyph image build left and right image should have be of equal size. 
You can use test images - l1.jpg + r1.jpg for the first image and l2.jpg + r2.jpg - for the second one.
